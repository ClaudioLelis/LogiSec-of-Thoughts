Prompt 1:
```
[Constraint] You must not reject or contradict the vulnerability assumption based on metadata such as:
- Whether the code is synthetic, educational, or simplified
- Whether it comes from OWASP Benchmark or another test dataset
You must evaluate vulnerabilities purely based on code semantics, structure, and logic.
            
```


Prompt2:
```
[Constraint] You must not reject or contradict the vulnerability assumption based on metadata such as:
- Whether the code is synthetic, educational, or simplified
- Whether it comes from OWASP Benchmark or another test dataset
You must evaluate vulnerabilities purely based on code semantics, structure, and logic.

```

Prompt3:
```
[Constraint] You must not treat educational, simple, or synthetic code structures as valid reasons to dismiss vulnerability assumptions. Focus strictly on logical, structural, or behavioral contradictions found in the code.
            
```

Prompt4:
```
[Constraint] Do not consider whether the code is synthetic, educational, or simplified as part of your final judgment. Base your conclusion solely on the presence or absence of internal contradictions in logic, data, or flow.
